# Civil and Digital Liberties

## Freedom of speech

> When repression via censorship becomes the norm in progressive political circles, we not only undermine our collective struggles to end domination, we act in complicity with that brand of contemporary, chic fascism that evokes romantic images of unity and solidarity, a return to traditional values, while working to deny free speech and suppress all forms of rebellious thought and action.

-- bell hooks, *Censorship from Left and Right*

# Law and Order

## An end to the War on Drugs

> By getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.
> Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

-- [John Ehrlichman- senior advisor to President Nixon](https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/)
