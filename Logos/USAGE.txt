Usage of the logos contained in this directory is subject to the Identity Style Guide:

https://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/Identity_Style_Guide#Logo

Logos contained in this directory but not listed in the Identity Style Guide on the wiki are not official party logos. For example, assorted Creative Commons symbols are included there for convenience. 

N.B. The terms "negative" (or "positive") are not emotional indicators - rather, "negative" logos are for use over dark[er] backgrounds, and "positive" logos for use on white or very light backgrounds. 

In particular:

- the 'tapebones' logo is appropriate for use in broader pirate movement things, e.g. a local discussion group;
- those contained in the 'Experiments' subdirectory are experiments and should not be used without specific approval.


Yes, yes, this isn't very Creative Commons, I know.


# Render Script

You can now run `python3 RenderLogos.py` to generate an index file for the logos.
The index file is at `index.html`; image output is placed into `./Renders/`.
